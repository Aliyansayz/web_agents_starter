_desc">### Project Introduction:

We are seeking a developer to complete a small, well-defined task to evaluate their basic coding skills and how well they work within a structured development environment. The successful completion of this task will help us assess the quality of your code and determine the potential for future collaboration on a larger project involving the development of a web application using the Remix framework.

If this initial task is completed to a high standard, there will be opportunities for further work, including more complex development within the Remix framework. Therefore, you should be prepared to learn and work within this framework as part of your future responsibilities.

A general requirement for this task is **at least 3 years of development experience**. The developer who demonstrates a good level of coding and cooperation will be considered for ongoing work on future projects.

This task involves creating a simple React and TypeScript-based web application and ensuring the solution adheres to basic software engineering best practices. The final output should be a functional, maintainable codebase that is ready for deployment and should be shared via a GitHub repository.

### Task Overview:

The goal of this task is to create a basic grocery list management tool, focusing on the ability to create, update, and delete grocery items. The interface should be implemented using basic HTML elements without any design work. The primary objective is functionality, not presentation.

This is a time-bound task designed to be completed within 4 hours. The focus is on the implementation of key CRUD operations, the use of local storage for data persistence, and implementing basic tests.

### Functional Requirements:

1. **Grocery List Management**
    
    The application should allow the user to manage a list of groceries. The user should be able to:
    
    - Add new grocery items.
    - Edit existing grocery items.
    - Delete unnecessary grocery items.
    - Update the status of each grocery item between "pending" and "purchased."
2. **Data Structure**
    
    Each grocery item should contain the following fields:
    
    - Name
    - ID (unique identifier)
    - Amount
    - Notes (optional)
    - Status (either "pending" or "purchased")
3. **Persistence**
    
    The data for the grocery list should be stored using the browser's local storage, ensuring that the list persists across page refreshes. No server-side functionality is required.
    
4. **Testing**
    
    Basic tests should be written using a testing package of your choosing. The tests should validate the core functionality, such as adding, editing, and deleting grocery items.
    

### Technical Requirements:

- The application should be built using **React** and **TypeScript**.
- You are free to choose your preferred folder structure and coding approach, provided that it results in a maintainable and functional application.
- The code should be well-organized and ready to be built without errors.
- Once the task is completed, the codebase must be uploaded to a **GitHub repository** for review.</div>

The band, for example, launched their new album this week, so I need it done.

I am keen to build a longer-term, ongoing arrangement once you get to know me and we work well together. (and potentially a continuous stream of work) )

Site 1 is for a COnsulting COmpany, and it's mainly linking CMS elements. But I messed up somewhere and don't have time to restart and learn. This round, I just need help to get it done. That is pretty much it. It shouldn't take long, but two days is enough time to have a go, and now I am running out of time.

Site 2 is for a Band. There is also some urgency. Everything is done with some minor tweaks. It is also CMS-related. I want to learn how to order CMS elements and how to embed them, like their Albums. 

All the work is done, just some minor adjustments and guidance. </div>
