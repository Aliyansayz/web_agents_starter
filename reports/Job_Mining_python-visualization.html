________________________________________

Timeline: 2 days

Only apply if you have experience with pythonanywhere, make.com and airtable

Overview:
Developer to automate the conversion of text data into structured tables and visualizations. The workflow will involve integrating Airtable, Make.com and PythonAnywhere to execute Python scripts that process text output (tables in markdown syntax) from a webhook. The final deliverables are:
•	Tables saved as .csv files
•	Visualizations saved as .png images

Customization variables controlling the table's appearance, formatting, and file naming will be dynamically retrieved from Airtable via Make.com. All API keys required for the integration must be securely stored and accessed from the Airtable base.
________________________________________

Scope of Work:

1.	Make.com Integration:
o	API Setup:
-	Create a Make.com scenario that sends text of a table in markdown syntax (dummy data) via API request
-	Create a Make.com scenario that receives the text data from the webhook
-	Configure the scenario to trigger the Python script hosted on PythonAnywhere.
o	Data Handling:
-	Ensure the .csv and .png files generated by the Python script are returned to Make.com for further processing and storage.
o	Airtable Connection:
-	Set up Make.com to pull dynamic variables from Airtable that control formatting, file naming, and securely retrieve all necessary API keys.

2.	PythonAnywhere Scripting:
o	Script Development:
-	Write a Python script that:
-	Converts input text into a structured table using pandas.
-	Generates a visualization of the table using matplotlib and saves it as a .png file.
-	Implement dynamic file naming for both .csv and .png files based on variables from Airtable.
-	Securely access API keys from Airtable as needed.
-	Track API costs and log into airtable

o	Hosting and Execution:
-	Host the script on PythonAnywhere and ensure it can be triggered remotely via Make.com.

o	Error Handling and Logging:
-	Include robust error handling to catch and log exceptions.
-	Log key actions such as data received, files created, and formatting applied.
-	Ensure that API keys are not exposed in logs or error messages.

3.	Airtable Integration:
o	Variable and Credential Management:
-	Retrieve customization variables from Airtable for:
-	Font size and style
-	Cell background colors
-	Borders and gridlines
-	Text alignment
-	Cell size and column/row spanning
-	File naming conventions (e.g., timestamp, prefixes/suffixes)
-	Securely retrieve all API keys required for Make.com, PythonAnywhere, and any other services involved in the workflow.

o	Validation:
-	Validate the retrieved variables to ensure they are correctly formatted and safe to use.
-	Verify that the API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.

4.	Testing and Documentation:
o	Testing:
-	Thoroughly test the entire workflow using your own Make.com account and PythonAnywhere environment.
-	Validate that the tables and visualizations are correctly generated and formatted.
-	Test the secure retrieval and use of API keys from Airtable to ensure functionality and security.

o	Documentation:
-	Provide a Make.com scenario template with setup instructions.
-	Document how to configure Airtable variables and how they affect the output.
-	Include troubleshooting steps for common errors.
-	Detail the process for securely storing and accessing API keys from Airtable.

We are seeking an experienced AI Developer with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-based image processing systems to help build a cutting-edge tool for creating dynamic, sports-related social media graphics. This tool will leverage LLMs and a provided library of creative graphic examples to intelligently design graphics based on raw photos uploaded by users, transforming them into professional-grade sports visuals.

The ideal candidate will have experience working with LLM-based models and should be comfortable creating a system that can understand the style and aesthetic from a provided dataset, applying that knowledge to newly uploaded photos.

Key Responsibilities:

Build and Train an AI System: Create an AI tool using LLMs capable of transforming raw photos of athletes into highly stylized social media graphics, applying creative designs based on the company's extensive library of examples.

Work with Provided Training Data: Use the company’s library of pre-designed sports-related images and graphics to train the LLM. Ensure the model learns to replicate and creatively adjust these styles to suit new user-submitted images.

Design an Intuitive User Experience: Allow users to upload photos of themselves or athletes and have the LLM tool autonomously design personalized graphics based on the visual data and the training examples.

Integrate Advanced Image Processing Techniques: Apply deep learning and AI-based image recognition methods to ensure the tool can understand and manipulate images, extracting athlete figures and creatively embedding them into complex design frameworks.

Collaborate Across Teams: Work closely with designers, data scientists, and other AI developers to ensure the graphics generated meet the high aesthetic standards expected for social media sharing.

Optimize and Scale the Tool: Ensure that the tool is computationally efficient, scalable, and able to handle high volumes of user uploads while maintaining design integrity.

Qualifications:
Experience with LLMs and AI Systems: Demonstrated experience in working with large language models and related AI systems, with a focus on image processing and graphic creation.

Expertise in Deep Learning & Computer Vision: Experience with frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for training AI models on image data and applying design aesthetics.

Graphic Design Integration: Familiarity with AI-driven design generation tools and the ability to integrate creative design patterns into AI workflows.

Programming Skills: Proficiency in Python and relevant AI/ML libraries. Experience with APIs and cloud-based solutions for large-scale image processing.

Understanding of Sports Media Aesthetics: The ability to create and train a system that understands the nuances of sports branding, social media trends, and how athletes should be presented visually.

English Proficiency: Excellent verbal and written communication skills are mandatory.

This is a highly challenging project.
Expectations for this role are very high. The task requires building a sophisticated AI system that can not only recognize athletes in raw images but also apply the learned design principles from the provided creative library to produce new, high-quality graphics. This will involve pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities to intelligently handle both image recognition and creative design generation.

Those looking for an easy project should not apply. We are looking for a problem-solver who thrives on challenging, cutting-edge AI projects and can produce exceptional results.

Custom AI Development: Develop an AI model capable of generating two images (roblox shirt and pants) that match each other, based on prompts provided by the user.

Prompt-based Generation: Implement a system where prompts are passed via a Python script, received through PHP (as the backend), and the AI model processes the prompt to generate matching images.

Image Pair Output: Ensure that for every input prompt, two corresponding images (roblox shirt and pants) are generated and returned to the user.

Model Training and Tuning: Fine-tune the model for performance, style matching, and accuracy to ensure the images generated are contextually appropriate and visually appealing.

API Integration: Create a functional system where Python handles the AI image generation logic and communicates with PHP to receive user input and return the results.</div>
