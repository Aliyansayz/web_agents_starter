                <div class="content" id="Python Developer for Scraping_desc">Hi everyone,
This project is a data extraction platform in the sports betting industry.

We need to improve performance, reliability, add new features (data to be extracted) and clean data.

For performance/cost optimization, you need to be able to identify bottlenecks whether that be CPU, memory, network, etc, and implement a logger which can give us insight into the performance of the scraper.

Another difficulty is efficiently managing the shared state between the scheduled jobs, and a bunch of data comprehension - so that no unneeded updates are pushed to the database.

It's built using Python requests and apscheduler, though we are certainly open to moving to different libraries for the sake of performance or other characteristics.

The project is defined in AWS SAM and uses API Gateway and Lambdas for providing the data, Fargate for the data extraction process and DynamoDB where data is stored.
For the sake of cost and performance optimization, we are interested in another DB service and moving from Fargate.

The proposed budget is intended for adding a few new endpoints with new data sources and some refactorings.</div>
