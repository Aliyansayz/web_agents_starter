1. We take user inputs from a form. 
2. The algorithm takes into account their preferences for food they like and don't like.
3. We calculate the calories they need to intake everyday and adapt the meal plan to meet these daily calories.
4. We generate a PDF document and send it to them

                <div class="content" id="Senior Fullstack Engineer_desc">Today, millions of employees looking for career growth are stuck between bad HR software and
impenetrable spreadsheets. There are no career development products that employees and
managers really want to use. That's not good enough. Managers should have the power to support their teams, and anyone should have the opportunity to be the best version of themselves and create careers that they love. We're building the solution to that. Progression brings clarity to
employees around their career growth, and simplicity and scalability to teams as they grow and
look to promote and reward employees for their hard work. That's just the start. Our mission is to
help everyone build a career that they love.

That's where you come in.
You'll be joining a small but high performing engineering team with a product focus and shipping
mindset. You'll help build features fundamental to the success of the business. You'll be working on a well maintained codebase spread across a Rails app and React and Tailwind based component library, with good test coverage and well used conventions and patterns.

Your skillset and experience:
 A passion for consistent, reusable and delightful frontend code
 Experience designing and building complex, scaling products using Ruby on Rails
 Experience designing and building complex, scaling products in Typescript & React
 Working with and building APIs, ideally in Ruby on Rails
 An understanding of what is required to produce clean, maintainable, secure, tested code.
 Strong communication and organisational skills  you'll be able to work effectively in teams
or work autonomously as needed

You'll have a great time if you want:
 The ability to prioritise, justify and manage your own roadmap
 To write a lot of code, move fast
 To learn unfamiliar things quickly so you can unblock yourself
 To work on the most business critical projects, whatever they are

We may not be the right fit if you'd like to:
 Work in a large product team with lots of other engineers
 Specialise in one aspect of engineering (e.g API design)
 Specialise in one language or framework (e.g. Rails or React)
 Work in an office!</div>
